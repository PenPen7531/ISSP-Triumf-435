# CSS Documentation
CSS or Cascading Style Sheet is a web development tool that allows us to position objects on a webpage, change the style and size of fonts, change colours, and more! You can be very creative with CSS. This document will talk about how we use CSS, what we did in this project, and some basic CSS styling. 

## Selecting Elements
There are multiple ways of selecting elements on an HTML page. Based on how specific the selector is, the higher the priority will be. From most priority to lowest, these are:
<ol>
<li>ID</li>
<li>Class</li>
<li>Elements</li>
</ol>
