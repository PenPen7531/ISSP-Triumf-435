# NGINX 
NGINX is a open source software that serves webpages to clients. This means that when connecting to our app, we are connecting to NGINX. NGINX will then serve the webpage based on the route. NGINX can also act as a reverse proxy, cache, load balancer, and a streaming service. 

## Why use NGINX
NGINX allows us to act as a reverse proxy to serve our webpage. NGINX is placed in front of our application to serve the webpage.
